<p>
I play lots of video games, on <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055380285">Steam</a> and on Xbox.
<br>
<br>
I have been playing video games since my uncle introduced me to his old NES. Since then I have played games on pc
starting with windows 98, on ps2, and xbox. My all time favorite video games are as follows:
</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</li>
<li>Minecraft</li>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops</li>
<li>Overwatch</li>
<li>Star Wars Battlefront II (2007)</li>
</ul>
<p> 
Video games are what got me interested in computers and technology. This lead to me chosing to study computer science.
I hope that I will still have time for them in the future because its one of my favorite ways to spend time with my brother and friends.
