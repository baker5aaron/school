<p>
I have a handful of friends, many of whom attend <a href="http://www.oc.edu">Oklahoma Christian Universtiy</a> as well.
I probably would not be at OC if it were not for my older friends that I went to highschool with liking it so much. 
<br>
<br>
Most of the people closest to me are people I have gone to school with or attended church with.
I like to play <a href="videogames.html"> video games</a>, go on trips, and play sports with my friends.
