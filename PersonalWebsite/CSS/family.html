<p>
My family is made up of 5 people. I have a mom, dad, brother and sister. 
</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Vicki - Mom</li>
<li>Matt - Dad</li>
<li>Emily - Sister</li>
<li>Nathan - Brother</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
I am the oldest child at 20, my sister is in the middle at 17, and my brother is 15. As a family we enjoy skiing together
and going to the lake when it's warm enough. We fish and sail with my dad. We all attended Wichita Christian School our whole lives
where our mother teaches kindergarten. We also enjoy playing sports.
